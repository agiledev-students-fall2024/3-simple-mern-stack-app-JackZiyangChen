Hello, my name is Jack Chen, and I am a student at NYU majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business and Math. I am very passionate about all things tech related, and I really enjoy building things having previously worked very closely with early stage startups. I also really enjoy learning about the latest technology, with a particular interest in Artificial Intelligence, System Design, and Big Data Infrastructure.

Outside of my professional life, I am a big soccer fan. My favorite team is FC Bayern Munchen based in Germany, so you can catch me watching their games on the weekends. I also like travelling, especially to rural places that are off the beaten path.
